          “Landscape of warfarin and clopidogrel pharmacogenetic variants in Qatari population from
           whole exome datasets”
        </b></p>
       <p><font size="2"> Aim: Pharmacogenetic landscapes of commonly used antiplatelet drugs, warfarin and clopidogrel 
         have been studied in-depth in many countries. However, there is a paucity of data to understand their patterns
         in the Arab populations. Materials & methods: We analyzed the whole exome sequencing datasets of 100 Qatar 
         individuals available in public domain with this perspective. Results: We characterized the allelic 
         distribution of variants routinely tested for warfarin and clopidogrel. We additionally evaluated the 
         population stratification and its effect on allele frequency distribution. Our analysis points to ethnic 
         differences in the frequency distribution even for the small population studied. Conclusion: This is one of the
         first and most comprehensive pharmacogenetic maps of variants associated with warfarin and clopidogrel for an Arab 
         population, which can help tailor the drug dosage to the population.

         “Escherichia coli biofilm: development and therapeutic strategies” 
        </b></p>
       <p><font size="2">Escherichia coli biofilm consists of a bacterial colony embedded in a matrix of extracellular 
         polymeric substances (EPS) which protects the microbes from adverse environmental conditions and results in infection.
         Besides being the major causative agent for recurrent urinary tract infections, E. coli biofilm is also responsible for
         indwelling medical device-related infectivity. The cell-to-cell communication within the biofilm occurs due to quorum 
         sensors that can modulate the key biochemical players enabling the bacteria to proliferate and intensify the resultant 
         infections. The diversity in structural components of biofilm gets compounded due to the development of antibiotic resistance, 
         hampering its eradication. Conventionally used antimicrobial agents have a restricted range of cellular targets and limited 
         efficacy on biofilms. This emphasizes the need to explore the alternate therapeuticals like anti-adhesion compounds, 
         phytochemicals, nanomaterials for effective drug delivery to restrict the growth of biofilm. The current review focuses on
         various aspects of E. coli biofilm development and the possible therapeutic approaches for prevention and treatment of 
         biofilm-related infections.

        “Microbial removal of arsenic: Mechanisms and Applications”
        </b></p>
       <p><font size="2">With the ever increasing environmental pollution caused by toxic inorganic pollutants, human 
         population is at a great health risk. According to EPA (Environment Protection Agency) silver (Au), arsenic (As),
         barium (Ba), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu) are the toxic inorganic components present in soil and water
         with arsenic being the most toxic. Over the course of evolution, microorganisms exposed to arsenic have developed 
         various mechanisms for their survival. These mechanisms make the heavy metals less toxic by affecting their speciation,
         availability, mobility or volatilization. The genes involved in arsenic bioconversions are well studied. Arsenic 
         bioremediation activity can be further improved by over-expressing genes or by using truncated pathways. This article 
         gives an overview of all major microbial pathways employed in arsenic transformation and finally how the use of genetically
         engineered bacteria can overcome these limitations making the process more efficient and economical.
